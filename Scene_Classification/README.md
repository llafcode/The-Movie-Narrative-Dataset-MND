Here we present the data for the story-related scene classification task, as described in the paper [MND: A New Dataset and Benchmark of Movie Scenes Classified by their Narrative Function]().

There are three folders: 
1. features/: the features of each scene in each movie.
2. labels/: the labels of each scene in each movie.
3. timestamps/: the stard and end timestamps (seconds) of each scene in each movie.

More details of the methodology and experiments can be found in the paper.
